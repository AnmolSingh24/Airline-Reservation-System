                    <b>[II] What are cookies?</b> <br><br>

                    'Cookies' are tiny text files that are stored by the browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla
                    Firefox, Chrome or Safari) when you visit our <br> Website. <br><br>

                    You can think of cookies as something that provides a “memory” for the Website. Cookies allow our
                    site to remember your <br> preferences and play an important role in making the site work better for
                    you. <br><br>

                    We use cookies to deliver to you a more user-friendly service by making it easier and faster for you
                    to use our Website or Mobile <br> Apps. Cookies help us understand whether you came to our Website
                    via a
                    search engine, or by some other method, and what were <br> the most popular elements of our Website
                    or
                    Mobile Apps. <br><br>

                    <b>[III] Types of cookies</b> <br><br>

                    There are two types of cookies: <br>

                    › <b>First-party cookies</b> are created by the site you visit, i.e. in this case, the Website. The
                    site is
                    shown in the address bar. <br>
                    › <b>Third-party cookies</b> are created by other sites. These sites own some of the content, like
                    ads or
                    images, that you see on the webpage you visit. <br><br>


                    <b>[IV] How do we use cookies?</b> <br><br>

                    A visit to our Website may generate the following types of cookies on your browser. <br><br>



                    <b>[V] How can you manage these cookies?</b> <br><br>

                    You may alter your consent preferences, including withdraw consent to non-essential cookies which
                    you have previously given at <br> any time by moving the on/off toggles below, or by clicking
                    'Reject all
                    non-essential cookies' to reject all optional cookies. Any <br> selections you make will be
                    automatically
                    saved and you may navigate away from the Cookie Policy. <br><br>

                    Our strictly necessary and preference cookies cannot be turned off. However, statistics or marketing
                    cookies can be turned on or off <br> by changing your cookie settings on our Website or Mobile Apps.
                    <br><br>

                    All recent versions of popular browsers give you a level of control over cookies. You can set your
                    browser to accept or reject all, or <br> certain, cookies. You may opt to delete cookies by going to
                    the
                    privacy or security setting and deleting the browsing history from <br> your browser by checking the
                    box
                    for 'Cookies and website data' or related header. <br><br>

                    If you do not want sites to store cookies on your PC, you can block cookies. But doing this might
                    prevent some pages from <br> displaying correctly, or you might get a message from a site letting
                    you
                    know that you need to allow cookies to view that site. <br><br>

                    You may also employ cookies blockers that are available to limit the collection of data by these
                    cookies and further block them. <br><br>

                    Also, if we wish to process your personal information in the future for any cookies, other than
                    these type of cookies mentioned <br> above, we will do so on the basis of your informed consent at
                    that
                    time. <br><br>

                    <b>[VI] Cookies set by third parties</b> <br><br>

                    Some content, advertising, and functionality on our Website or Mobile App may be provided by third
                    parties, <br> including third parties that are not affiliated with us. 'Third party cookies' are
                    cookies
                    set by a domain other than the one that you are visiting. When you visit our Website, third
                    party
                    organisations may place cookies on your browser, even if you are not a logged-in member of those
                    <br>
                    organisations. This is because third party cookies do not require you to actively engage with the
                    third party's content or visit their <br> site, just load a page on which the third party's
                    technology
                    sits. For example, we use third party technologies such as video and <br> audio hosting platforms to
                    enable you to watch videos and listen to podcasts on our Website. The providers of these
                    technologies <br> may deploy cookies to your browser when you visit the pages on our site where we
                    are
                    using their technologies. <br><br>

                    These cookies may inform the third-party organisations about your visit to our site which may be
                    used by those organisations to <br> deliver targeted messages and advertising to you. In all cases,
                    we do
                    not set these cookies and we have no access to the information <br> that they gather. Such cookies
                    are
                    subject to the third-party organisations' own cookie policies. <br><br>

                    <b>[VII] Grievance redressal:</b> <br><br>

                    If you have any queries or complaints concerning our use of your personal information or our Cookie
                    Policy, please email us on the <br> following address: <b>data.privacy@bluewing.com</b>

                    Please also visit our <a href="/Internal-Info/Privacy Policy/Policy.html">Privacy Policy,</a> which
                    explains how we collect your personal information, what
                    we do with it and your rights in <br> respect of it. <br><br>

                    <b>[VIII] Amendment of this cookie policy</b> <br><br>

                    We may amend this Cookie Policy with immediate effect from time to time to comply with law or to
                    meet our changing business <br> requirements and will notify you as required under applicable laws.
                    Where
                    local regulations require, we will obtain consent from you <br> for any new uses of any cookie. You
                    should read and review this page regularly to see if there have been any changes. <br><br>
