                    be
                    in effect. If any unlawful or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if a part of it
                    were <br> deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will
                    continue in
                    effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention <br> of the clause, in which case the
