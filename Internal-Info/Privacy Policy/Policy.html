                    Blue Wing values your privacy. Our privacy policy (“<b>Privacy Policy</b>") applies to all of the
                    Personal Data

                    “Blue Wing”, “we”, “us”, or “our” in <br> this Privacy Policy. Blue Wing Limited is the controller

                    other policies if your travel plans <br> include travel on other airlines, as those policies may
                    differ

                    As per Blue Wing's business practices, we may collect Personal Data from you. “Personal Information”
                    or “Personal Data” means any <br> information about an individual from which that person can be
                    identified. <br><br>

                    We currently collect and process the following Personal Data: <br><br>

                    › nationality; <br>
                    › your itinerary; <br>
                    › travel documents and visa details (for example: passport details); <br>
                    › meal preferences; <br>
                    › travel preferences; <br>

                    information; <br>
                    › health details (for example: medical history, medical issues, or any allergies); <br>
                    › IP addresses, device information, and browser information; <br>
                    › marketing and communication preferences; <br> <br>
                    Where permissible under applicable law, we may process special categories of Personal Data, such as
                    health information to assess your <br> fitness to travel or in relation to special assistance
                    requests and biometric voice recordings to confirm your identity. Subject to applicable <br> laws,

                    and

                    platforms.
                    Please be aware that we are not <br> responsible for the privacy practices of web sites not operated

                    personally
                    identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our

                    Personal Data outside the European Economic Area. <br><br>

                    immediately by contacting us via <br> the contact details given in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>

                    <b>XII. Changes to this Privacy Statement</b> <br><br>
